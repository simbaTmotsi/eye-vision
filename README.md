Eye Vision provides a simple but powerful python library for Computer Vision. It uses
well know libraries like OpenCv and Matplotlib. Typical usage
often looks like this::

    import ziso
    from ziso import read
    from ziso import view
    
    # to read the image in the rgb color scale
    file = read.rgb("test.jpg")
    # to view the image
    view.im(file)
    
    # to view the easter egg in the library
    from ziso import zen
