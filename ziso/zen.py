    The Zen of Computer Vision, by Simbarashe Timothy Motsi

    Only worry about the past when you have functioning a time machine.
    No one will thank you, but even if they did then what?
    Failing is better than never attempting.
    Money can be made but not life.
    Take time to rest.

    Time is expensive.>> Tsapo 
    Poverty is a state of mind.>> Shingai Shamu 
    Problems are merely a test on endurance.>> Prisca Chigudu
    The greatest reward is inner peace.>> Dr Panashe Chiurunge 
    Rest and be kind, you donâ€™t have to prove anything.>> Jack Kerouac 
    It's easy to tell the truth than convince people of a lie.>> Atish Dullab 
    The search for happiness is one of the chief sources of unhappiness.>> Eric Hoffer  
    Every situation properly perceived, becomes an opportunity to learn how to grow and help others.>> Dr Beril Sirmacek
